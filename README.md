Brainer is tool that can actually be used as a textbook. You can write in everything you want to. It will be saved and it is easily readable.

To be used as it is, you must run the app.coffee file. Using the command 'coffee app.coffee', make sure you have coffeescript installed globally. To store all the data, you must run a MongoDB database.

All setup of Brainer can be made in config/index.coffee
